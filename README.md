# SERL-project
Multi-label learning deals with the problem where one object may be associated with one or more labels. This project deals with a framework named SERL. SERL learns better representation of the original features in the supervision of softmax regression. To show the efficiency of this model, it has been compared with the efficiencies of some of the most commonly used multi-label classification algorithms.
It uses softmax regression whose class is defined in this project. The softmax regression class has all the important functions such as fit, predict, etc.
This project also includes a research paper related to this softmax regression based multi-label classification.
