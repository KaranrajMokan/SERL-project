A telegram bot which tracks Products price in Amazon and pings you whenever the price drops below your threshold value.

  - Multi-label learning deals with the problem where one object may be associated with one or more labels
  - This project deals with a framework named SERL. 
  - SERL learns better representation of the original features in the supervision of softmax regression. 
  - To show the efficiency of this model, it has been compared with the efficiencies of some of the most commonly used multi-label classification algorithms. 
  -  It uses softmax regression whose class is defined in this project. 
  -  The softmax regression class has all the important functions such as fit, predict, etc. 
  -  his project also includes a research paper related to this softmax regression based multi-label classification.
